Thanks for helping making KEDA better!

## Shipping a new version

You can easily release a new Helm chart version:

1. Update the version of the Helm chart in `Chart.yaml`
2. Package the Helm chart 
   - For KEDA:
    ```shell
    $ helm package keda
    Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: C:\Code\GitHub\charts\keda-0.1.0.tgz
    ```
   - For HTTP Addon:
    ```shell
    $ helm package http-add-on
    Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: /home/ecomaz/src/keda/charts/keda-add-ons-http-0.2.0.tgz
    ```
3. Move the new chart to the docs folder:
```shell
$ mv keda-*.tgz docs
```
4. Re-index the Helm repo to add our new version:
```shell
$ helm repo index docs --url https://kedacore.github.io/charts
```
5. Commit changes:
```shell
git add .
git commit -sm "Packaged new Helm chart version"
git push origin chart-release
```
6. Create a pull request with our new Helm index
7.  Create a GitHub release for your new Helm chart version by using the following template

> *Chart: {{Chart Version}} | App: {{App Name}}*
> {{Description about the Helm chart}}
> 
> ## TL;DR
> ```shell
> helm repo add keda https://kedacore.github.io/charts

## Developer Certificate of Origin: Signing your work

### Every commit needs to be signed

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the DCO, reformatted for readability:
```
By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to commit messages.

```
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```
Git even has a `-s` command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:
```
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

Each Pull Request is checked  whether or not commits in a Pull Request do contain a valid Signed-off-by line.

### I didn't sign my commit, now what?!

No worries - You can easily replay your changes, sign them and force push them!

```
git checkout <branch-name>
git reset $(git merge-base master <branch-name>)
git add -A
git commit -sm "one commit on <branch-name>"
git push --force
```
